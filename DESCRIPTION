Title: Build panel data sets from PSID raw data

Description: Makes it easy to build panel data in wide format from PSID
    delivered raw data. The package takes care of merging data from each wave
    onto a cross-period index file, so that individuals can be followed over
    time. The user must specifiy which years they are interested, and the PSID
    variable names (e.g. ER21003) for each year (they differ in each year).
    There are different panel data designs and two popular subsetting criteria
    (heads only and core sample only) implemented.
